GitHub questions

1.	What is GIT fast forward?
GIT fast forward is when you can make a direct path between branches (so one branch will be a direct descendent of the master branch).
2.	Describe the process of a merge conflict.
I was not able to do the merge conflict, since I started on the assignment very late in the week and was not able to get help.
3.	How do you see which branch you are on?
You can see this by looking at the “branch” on the main repo page.
4.	Briefly describe a pull-request.
This lets you tell others when you have edited or changed something in a GitHub repo, and they will be able to review them.
